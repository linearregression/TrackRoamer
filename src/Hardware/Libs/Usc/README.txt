Pololu USB Software Development Kit
 The Pololu USB Software Development Kit is a package that contains the code you need for making your own PC applications that control Pololu USB Devices.
 The code lets you easily use the native USB interfaces of the devices, allowing access to more features than the virtual COM ports.
 For each supported device, there is a class library that allows your program to interact with the device using simple, high-level function calls.
 The kit also contains complete example applications. Most of the code is written in C#, but there are Visual Basic .NET and Visual C++ examples for both the Maestro and the Simple Motor Controller.
 Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista, and 7) and Linux are supported.
